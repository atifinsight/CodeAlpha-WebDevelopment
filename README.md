# Web Development Tasks â€“ CodeAlpha Internship

This repository contains the completed web development tasks assigned during the **CodeAlpha Internship Program**. I have successfully developed both projects â€” **Task 1: Age Calculator** and **Task 2: To-Do List** â€” strictly following the provided requirements and specifications.

Each task demonstrates the use of fundamental front-end technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and showcases my ability to build functional, interactive web applications.

## âœ… Task 1: Age Calculator

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Develop a web-based **Age Calculator** that accurately calculates a user's age from their Date of Birth.

### ðŸ“Œ Implementation:
I created an interactive form where users can input their **Day, Month, and Year of birth**, and the application outputs their current **age in years, months, and days**. The calculation is handled using JavaScriptâ€™s `Date` object, and the entire process includes input validation to ensure correct values are entered.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack:
- **HTML** â€“ for building the input form structure
- **CSS** â€“ for styling and responsive layout
- **JavaScript** â€“ for age calculation logic

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Applied:
- DOM Manipulation
- JavaScript Date & Time functions
- Input validation techniques

I have ensured that all functional and technical requirements mentioned in the task description have been met successfully.

## âœ… Task 2: To-Do List Web Application

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Build a dynamic **To-Do List** web app that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently.

### ðŸ“Œ Implementation:
The application allows users to **add new tasks**, **mark them as completed**, **edit existing tasks**, and **delete tasks**. Additionally, I integrated optional support for **localStorage**, so that tasks persist even after refreshing the page or reopening the browser.

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack:
- **HTML** â€“ for the base structure
- **CSS** â€“ for layout and styling
- **JavaScript** â€“ for task management logic

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts Applied:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- JavaScript Event Handling (click, submit)
- Local Storage for persistent data

This task was completed in full accordance with the internship's project requirements and reflects my understanding of how to implement practical JavaScript functionalities.
